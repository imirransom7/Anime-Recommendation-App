There is crime everywhere we go, no matter what. The point of this application is not to scare you,
but to keep you aware and alert on.
This application will help determine wether a certain location of your choosing is safe option or not.
This will and can be used by many. Whether it is for a businesss trip or a family vaction, this app is right for you. Its other purpose
is to help people travel saftely, especially those whom may have not traveled before.
The data that is collected and being analyzed to help support my findings on whether a country is safe will be determined off of criminal activiy/crimes reported in specified counrties. The user
will be able to cylce through the data presented for each country to see to see if it is safe to travel there. They can see crime rates for the current month, and year. They can even go
back a few years and check to see if there is a trend during different times of the year at specific months.

-No longer will you have to leave the country with uncertainty!

-Use this app to plan your trip accordingly

-The tools I will be using are Pyhton, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Jdango/Flask, JHipster, MySQL, HTML, CSS3
